# Abstract
This project applies multivariable calculus to generate a dynamic vector field from Vincent Van Gogh’s self-portrait by using the concepts of curl and divergence. It is inspired by the visual turbulence behind his work, I mathematically simulate swirling and expanding vector behavior to explore revisiting famous artworks through math. It was created as a submission to the Steven Strogatz Prize, this project aims to communicate mathematical ideas in an intuitive and creative way, emphasizing the math behind Van Gogh’s art.
